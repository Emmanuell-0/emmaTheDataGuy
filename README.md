## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Data Analyst with a strong accounting and finance foundation**, focused on turning raw data into clear, actionable insights.

With an **ACA qualification** and a **BSc in Accounting**, I combine financial reasoning with technical tools such as **SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI** to analyze data, automate reporting, and support informed decision-making.

My experience spans **operations, finance, and analytics**, working with real-world datasets to:
- Clean and structure data  
- Build dashboards and reports  
- Visualize trends and performance  
- Communicate insights clearly to stakeholders  

I’m particularly interested in **business performance analysis**, **automation**, and **data-driven strategy**.

I enjoy building practical solutions, learning continuously, and applying analytical thinking to real problems.  
Currently, I’m focused on expanding my analytics portfolio and contributing value within **data-driven teams**.
