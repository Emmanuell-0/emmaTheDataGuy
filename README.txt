## About Me

I’m a **Data Analyst with a strong accounting and finance foundation**, trained to turn raw data into clear, actionable insights.

With an **ACA qualification** and a **BSc in Accounting**, I combine financial reasoning with technical tools such as **SQL, Python, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI** to analyze data, automate reporting, and support decision-making.

My background spans **operations, finance, and analytics**, where I’ve worked with real-world datasets — cleaning, structuring, visualizing, and communicating results in a way stakeholders can understand. I’m especially interested in **business performance analysis, automation, and data-driven strategy**.

I enjoy building practical solutions, learning continuously, and applying analytical thinking to real problems. Currently, I’m focused on expanding my analytics portfolio and contributing value in **data-driven teams**.
